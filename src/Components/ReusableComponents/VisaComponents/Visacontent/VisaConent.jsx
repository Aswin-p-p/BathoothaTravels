      <p>A travel visa is essential for entry into many foreign countries, including the USA, Australia, Canada, and various Middle Eastern nations. These countries require you to have a valid visa before arrival. However, some destinations, like Bhutan, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, the Maldives, and Cambodia, offer visas on arrival, allowing you to obtain your entry permit once you land. For most other countries, though, you’ll need to secure your visa before departing from your home country.</p>
