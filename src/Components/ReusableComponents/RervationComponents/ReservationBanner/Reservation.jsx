    <h5>Passenger Information</h5>
    <p>
      Passengers are responsible for securing the necessary Entry or Transit Visas for their destination or any stopovers. For instance, flights to New Zealand that involve a stop in Australia or flights to Canada that transit through the United States require appropriate visas. It's advised to consult the relevant embassies or consulates before departure to verify passport and visa requirements. Bathootha Travel is not liable for issues arising from incomplete or incorrect travel documents or unmet visa requirements.

In such cases, alternative arrangements will be offered, and standard cancellation policies will apply if you decline the alternatives.
